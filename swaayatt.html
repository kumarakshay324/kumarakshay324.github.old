		<p style="text-align:left;margin:3%"> <a href="https://www.swaayatt-robots.com"><b>Swaayatt Robots Pvt. Ltd</b></a> is a Bhopal based upcoming robotics startup with high end research oriented towards intelligent robotics, a first in India. It's primary goal is development the prototype for the self-driving vehicles. I worked on the primary stage of the hardware development designing the mechanisms for the automation of the various joints and their control system. </p>


			<h2> SELF DRIVING VEHICLE </h2>
						<p style="text-align:left;margin:3%"> <b>METHODOLOGY</b></p>
			<p style="text-align:justify;margin:3%;margin-left:3%;margin-right:3%;"> All the controls of the SUV(Mahindra Bolero) to be modified, were studied. The mechanisms for clutch, accelerator, manual transmission gear setup, brake and steering were undertood and their primary power transmission methods were undertood to find out sites for automation keeping the manual controls intact. External setups for all these controls were installed using stepper motors for precision control and feedbacks from a range of sensors for closed-loop operation.  </p>
			<p style="text-align:left;margin:3%"> <b>DESIGN MECHANISMS & RESULTS</b></p>
			<p style="text-align:left;margin:3%"> <b>•</b> &nbsp;&nbsp; The clutch and brake were automated using specially designed arc shaped rack and pinion setups that could provide position control over the extent of the press of these &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pedals.<br><b>•</b> &nbsp;&nbsp; Gear automation setup was made by fusng two rack and pinion arrangements on the two horizontal axes. One on the X-axis controlled the position of the arm while the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;other axis, the Y-axis controlled the location of the head of the gear handle in different gears. The gear could be positioned in six settings - Gear Nos. 1 to 5 and reverse gear.<br><b>•</b> &nbsp;&nbsp; The accelerator has low torque requirement for motion and was thus automated using a simple spool arrangement for wire based pulley mechanism.<br><b>•</b> &nbsp;&nbsp; For precise measurement of the rotational speed of the rear wheels, each wheel is to be mounted with a two layer iron mounting that has extrusions to allow for magnetic &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spikes experienced in inductive proximity sensors. </p>

			<h2> MOBILE ROBOTIC RESEARCH PLATFORM - WITH A 6-DOF ROBOTIC ARM</h2>
			<p style="text-align:left;margin:3%"> <b>OBJECTIVE</b></p>
			<p style="text-align:justify;margin:3%;margin-left:3%;margin-right:3%;"> The project was to design a mobile robot with a 6-DOF robotic arm mounted on the top. This robot has indoor as well as outdoor applications with an arm for various grasping, picking and other articulate movements. The complete system is to culminate in an intelligent vision powered robot that learns and understands about its environment using a wide range of onboard sensors that form a complete closed loop system. </p>
